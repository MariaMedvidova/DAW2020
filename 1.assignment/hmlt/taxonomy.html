            <b>Taxonomy</b>
    </h2>

    <p>
        The taxonomy of squirrels, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS), is:

    <ul>
        <li>Kingdom: Animalia</li>
        <li>Phylum: Chordata</li>
        <li>Class: Mammalia</li>
        <li>Order: Rodentia</li>
        <li>Suborder: Sciuromorpha</li>
        <li>Family: Sciuridae</li>
        <li>Subfamilies: Callosciurinae (Southern Asian tree squirrels), Ratufinae (giant tree squirrels), Sciurillinae (South American pygmy squirrels), Sciurinae (includes flying squirrels), Xerinae (includes ground squirrels)
        </li>
        <li>Genera & species: 21 genera & more than 200 species, including Lariscus hosei (Four-striped ground squirrel), Exilisciurus whiteheadi (Tufted pygmy squirrel), Ratufa bicolor (Black giant squirrel), Glaucomys sabrinusi (Northern flying squirrel) and Tamiasciurus hudsonicus (Red squirrel)
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
            The living squirrels are divided into five subfamilies, with about 58 genera and some 285 species. The oldest squirrel fossil, Hesperopetes, dates back to the Chadronian (late Eocene, about 40â€“35 million years ago) and is similar to modern flying squirrels.

    <p>
            The main group of squirrels also can be split into three subgroups, which yield the remaining subfamilies. The Sciurinae contains the flying squirrels (Pteromyini) and the Sciurini, which among others contains the American tree squirrels; the former have often been considered a separate subfamily, but are now seen as a tribe of the Sciurinae. The pine squirrels (Tamiasciurus), on the other hand, are usually included with the main tree squirrel lineage, but appear to be about as distinct as the flying squirrels; hence, they are sometimes considered a distinct tribe, Tamiasciurini.
