            Welcome to the blog about

            Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae, a family that includes small or medium-size
            rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels, chipmunks, marmots
            (including groundhogs), flying squirrels, and prairie dogs amongst other rodents.
            Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by
            humans to Australia. The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene epoch,
            and among other living rodent families, the squirrels are most closely related to the mountain
            beaver and to the dormice.

            They belong to the Sciuridae family, which includes prairie dogs, chipmunks and marmots.
            There are more than 200 species of squirrels, according to the Integrated Taxonomic
            Information System (ITIS), and they are categorized into three types: tree squirrels,
            ground squirrels and flying squirrels.
    </p>

    <p>
        The tiniest squirrel is the aptly named African pygmy squirrelâ€”only five inches long from nose to tail. Others reach sizes shocking to those who are only familiar with common tree squirrels. The Indian giant squirrel is three feet long.

        Like other rodents, squirrels have four front teeth that never stop growing so they don't wear down from the constant gnawing. Tree squirrels are the types most commonly recognized, often seen gracefully scampering and leaping from branch to branch. Other species are ground squirrels that live in burrow or tunnel systems, where some hibernate during the winter season.

        Ground squirrels eat nuts, leaves, roots, seeds, and other plants. They also catch and eat small animals, such as insects and caterpillars. These small mammals must always be wary of predators because they are tasty morsels with few natural defenses, save flight. Sometimes groups of ground squirrels work together to warn each other of approaching danger with a whistling call.

        Tree squirrels are commonly seen everywhere from woodlands to city parks. Though they are terrific climbers, these squirrels do come to the ground in search of fare such as nuts, acorns, berries, and flowers. They also eat bark, eggs, or baby birds. Tree sap is a delicacy to some species.

        Flying squirrels are a third, adaptable type of squirrel. They live something like birds do, in nests or tree holes, and although they do not fly, they can really move across the sky. Flying squirrels glide, extending their arms and legs and coasting through the air from one tree to another. Flaps of skin connecting limbs to body provide a winglike surface. These gliding leaps can exceed 150 feet. Flying squirrels eat nuts and fruit, but also catch insects and even baby birds.
