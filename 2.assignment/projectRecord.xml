        <title>ABSTRACT:</title>
        <body>
            <section>XML, validated by the schema, together with the powerful processing via XSLT, allows to have added facilities in the treatment of information in a standard and shareable way . These are, in addition to other evident advantages, those that open the way for a more than probable evolution of this technology in commercial and research circles. Another important fact is related to the replacement of EDI interfaces by XML in business oriented applications.</section>
            <section>The work presented includes a schema, a stylesheet, and the instance of the schema in XML. The instance is the report itself.</section>
            <section>The work intends to define an expeditious and functional structure , which can be applied to a descriptive work, such as a thesis. It is not the objective of the work to create a systematic implementation of all possible objects, but rather to create some more common uses to exemplify the power of these languages.</section>
